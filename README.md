# Landmarks - SwiftUI Tutorial Project
This repository contains my implementation of the SwiftUI tutorial app from Apple's official documentation. The project was completed as part of my journey learning SwiftUI framework.
# About the Project
This app was built by following Apple's SwiftUI tutorial available at developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui. The tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
